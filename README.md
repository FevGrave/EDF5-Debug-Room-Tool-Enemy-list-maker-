# EDF5-Debug-Room-Tool
a gui to make lightweight changes to my earth defense force 5 debug room without the user having to learn (and change) the code themselves.

edf5 mission modding, currently, requires a solid amount of understanding and effort. my goal is to both create a tool to broaden the usage of a debug room i've created for an average user, as well as lower the barrier to entry, hopefully encouraging more people to look deeper into modding the game. i'm also hoping to be setting the groundwork for more user friendly modding tools.



HOW TO USE:

install BlueAmulet's ModLoader: https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDFModLoader

download Kittopia's Unnamed EDF Tools: https://gitlab.com/kittopiacreator/edf-tools

after downloading, find EDF Tools.exe, located in the Release folder and copy it to my tool's directory

launch run.bat

select the enemies you wish to be spawnable in the map, and their variant if applicable

click Confirm

move the newly created MISSION.Bvm file into the included Mods/Mission/M003 folder

copy the Mods folder into your root EDF5 directory, load into offline mission 3

there are four shooting targets with functions upon being destroyed. 3 of them are tied to spawning the enemies you selected, with one tied to completing the mission

enjoy!



important notes about the current state of this repo:

the first releasable state of the tool is going to focus on enemy spawns.

as the tool takes more shape i'll link to edf5 modding resources, however in the meantime i encourage you to join the official earth defense force discord server, where a modding channel is set-up. it's a fantastic place to ask questions and get help, doing so being how i got into modding edf5 in the first place just a few weeks ago.
